I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology, focusing on Computer Architecture. I'm a member of the [HPArch Lab](http://hparch.gatech.edu/index.html) advised by Professor [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hyesoon/).

I'm also a Research Scientist at [Georgia Tech Research Institute](https://gtri.gatech.edu/) working in the Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Lab. Prior to this, I have worked in industry with machine learning, speech and voice recognition algorithms.

# Research

My research interest is in accelerator architectures (such as GPUs, machine learning accelerators, and FPGAs) and exploring ways to expand the scope of problems to which they can be applied through hardware and software improvements. Post Moore's Law and Dennard scaling, it seems likely that large jumps in performance will have to come through novel acceleration architectures and sophisticated compiler techniques. I hope to advance the development of these new techniques and architectures.
